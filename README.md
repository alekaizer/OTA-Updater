OTA-Updater
===========

OTA Updater coded for the purpose of a class, at UTBM France, the app
is supposed to simulate a third part android os update app, in order
to be added to the own made kernel we produced during labs

1- The purpose
During this class we had to produce an home made android system, running on a Pandaboard.
The system had been built to control an usb missile launcher. 
This app had been asked to manage the built system updating's, this app check if new ver-
sion of the system is available then simulate an update by rebooting.

We could have set an update package but it wasn't on the planning.
